#####Information we think is necessary for the correct evaluation of our project: ######

IMPORTANT: Karina and marine did an exchange program during the 1st semester therefore didn't have the java lectures. 
	   Thus, we learnt it while doing this project. 

Database team: (Nassim EL'MRABTI, Marine ELISABETH)
	As we did the XP extreme program practice (one of us codding and the other one reviewing). The codding was mostly done on Nassim computer 
	using Teams (which enable people to do actions on someone else computer) as Marine's computer didn't really support this function of Teams.
	Which resulted in the fact that most of the commits in the database were done by Nassim but don't mean that more of the coding was done 
	by him.

Networking team : (Ilyes AIT EL MENCEUR, Karina MOUSSAOUI) 
	Also, did the coder and reviewer practice. 

GUI team: (Rebecca LEE YI HSUAN, Celine LAM) 
	All the GUI structure implementation was done by Rebecca alone.
